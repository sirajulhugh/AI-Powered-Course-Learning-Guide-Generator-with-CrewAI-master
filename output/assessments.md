**Python Programming Assessment Plan: A 3-Month Curriculum**

This assessment plan outlines quizzes, coding challenges, and practical projects to track learning progress throughout a 3-month Python curriculum.  Each assessment is designed to evaluate the learning objectives of the corresponding module and week.


**Module 1: Introduction to Programming and Python Fundamentals (4 Weeks)**

**Week 1: What is Programming? & Setting up your Environment**

* **Quiz:** Multiple choice questions covering basic programming concepts, Python installation, and IDE setup. (5 questions)
* **Coding Challenge:** Write a "Hello, World!" program and navigate basic command-line operations.

**Week 2: Data Types and Variables**

* **Quiz:** Multiple choice and short-answer questions covering data types (integers, floats, strings, booleans), variable assignment, type conversion, and operators. (10 questions)
* **Coding Challenge:** Write a program that performs basic arithmetic operations on user-provided inputs, handling potential type errors.

**Week 3: Control Flow (Conditional Statements and Loops)**

* **Quiz:** Multiple choice and short-answer questions on conditional statements (`if`, `elif`, `else`), loops (`for`, `while`), and control flow statements (`break`, `continue`). (10 questions)
* **Coding Challenge:** Create a program that determines if a number is prime or generates a Fibonacci sequence up to a specified limit.

**Week 4: Data Structures: Lists and Tuples**

* **Quiz:** Multiple choice and short-answer questions on lists and tuples, including creation, accessing elements, manipulation, and list comprehensions (basic introduction). (10 questions)
* **Coding Challenge:**  Implement a program to manage a list of student names, allowing for adding, removing, and sorting.


**Module 2: Functions, Modules, and Working with Files (4 Weeks)**

**Week 5: Functions**

* **Quiz:** Multiple choice and short-answer questions on function definition, parameters, arguments, return values, scope, and lambda functions. (10 questions)
* **Coding Challenge:** Create functions to perform different mathematical calculations (e.g., factorial, greatest common divisor) and test them.

**Week 6: Modules and Packages**

* **Quiz:** Questions on importing modules, using built-in modules (e.g., `math`, `random`), installing packages using pip, and using external libraries. (10 questions)
* **Coding Challenge:**  Use the `requests` library to retrieve data from a public API.

**Week 7: Working with Files**

* **Quiz:** Multiple choice and short-answer questions on file operations (opening, reading, writing, closing), handling file exceptions, and different file modes. (10 questions)
* **Coding Challenge:** Create a program that reads data from a text file, processes it, and writes the processed data to another file.

**Week 8: Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) Introduction**

* **Quiz:** Multiple choice and short-answer questions on basic OOP concepts: classes, objects, methods, attributes, constructors, and basic inheritance. (10 questions)
* **Coding Challenge:** Create a simple class representing a bank account with methods for deposit, withdrawal, and balance check.



**Module 3: Advanced Topics and Projects (4 Weeks)**

**Week 9: Dictionaries and Sets**

* **Quiz:** Multiple choice and short-answer questions on dictionaries and sets, including creation, accessing elements, operations, and methods. (10 questions)
* **Coding Challenge:** Create a program that uses a dictionary to store and retrieve student information (name, ID, grades).

**Week 10: Working with External Libraries (NumPy, Pandas - Introduction)**

* **Quiz:** Multiple choice and short-answer questions on NumPy arrays, basic NumPy operations, Pandas DataFrames, reading CSV files, and basic Pandas data manipulation. (10 questions)
* **Coding Challenge:** Perform basic data analysis (mean, median, etc.) on a dataset using NumPy and Pandas.

**Week 11: Intermediate OOP Concepts**

* **Quiz:** Questions on polymorphism, encapsulation, abstraction, class methods, and static methods. (10 questions)
* **Coding Challenge:** Design a more complex class structure, demonstrating inheritance and polymorphism (e.g., different types of vehicles).

**Week 12: Project Work and Review**

* **Milestone Project:** A comprehensive project that integrates the skills learned throughout the 3 months.  This could be a game, a data analysis application, a simple web scraper, etc.  The project will be assessed based on functionality, code quality, and documentation.


**Monthly Milestones:**

* **Month 1:** Completion of Module 1, demonstrating proficiency in basic Python syntax, data structures, and control flow.
* **Month 2:** Completion of Module 2, showcasing understanding of functions, modules, file handling, and basic OOP concepts.
* **Month 3:** Completion of Module 3 and the final project, demonstrating advanced Python skills and the ability to apply learned concepts to a larger project.


This assessment plan provides a flexible framework.  The number of questions and the complexity of coding challenges can be adjusted based on student progress and learning pace.  Regular feedback and support are crucial for successful learning.
