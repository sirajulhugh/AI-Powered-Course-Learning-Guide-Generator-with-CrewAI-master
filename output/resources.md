Based on the provided curriculum and learning schedule, here's a curated list of learning resources for Python, categorized for easier navigation.  Note that this is a starting point; you should research each further to determine the best fit for your learning style.

**I. Online Courses:**

* **Paid:**
    * **Udemy:** Search Udemy for "Complete Python Bootcamp" or similar beginner-focused courses.  Udemy frequently has sales, making even paid courses affordable.  Look for high ratings and a substantial number of reviews.
    * **Coursera:** Coursera offers courses from universities and organizations worldwide. Look for courses focusing on Python fundamentals, often with specializations for a more comprehensive learning path.  Some courses are free to audit, but certifications typically involve a fee.
    * **Codecademy:** Codecademy's interactive Python course is a popular option for beginners.  It's a paid subscription service, but offers a structured learning experience.
    * **DataCamp:** DataCamp focuses on data science, so their Python courses are tailored towards data analysis and manipulation.  It's a paid subscription, but provides interactive exercises.
    * **LinkedIn Learning:** Similar to Udemy and Coursera, LinkedIn Learning offers a range of Python courses.  Check for beginner-friendly options.

* **Free (with potential paid certifications):**
    * **edX:** edX (from MIT and Harvard) offers free courses, but certificates usually involve a cost. Search for "Introduction to Python" or similar.
    * **Google's Python Class:** Google offers a free class suitable for those with some programming experience.  It's a good supplement after initial fundamentals.
