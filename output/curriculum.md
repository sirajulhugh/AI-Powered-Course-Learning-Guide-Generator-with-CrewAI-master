**Python Programming: A 3-Month Beginner Curriculum**

This curriculum is designed for beginners with no prior programming experience and aims to provide a solid foundation in Python programming within a 3-month timeframe (assuming approximately 10-15 hours of study per week).

**Module 1: Introduction to Programming and Python Fundamentals (4 weeks)**

* **Week 1:  What is Programming? & Setting up your Environment**
    * Learning Objectives: Understand the basic concepts of programming, set up Python development environment (installation, IDE selection - VSCode recommended),  basic command line usage.
    * Topics: What is programming?  Why Python?  Installing Python, Choosing an IDE,  First Python program ("Hello, world!"), basic command-line navigation.
* **Week 2: Data Types and Variables**
    * Learning Objectives: Understand different data types (integers, floats, strings, booleans), variable assignment, type conversion, basic operators (+, -, *, /, //, %, **).
    * Topics: Integers, Floats, Strings, Booleans, Variable Naming Conventions, Arithmetic Operators, Type Conversion, Operator Precedence.
* **Week 3: Control Flow (Conditional Statements and Loops)**
    * Learning Objectives: Use conditional statements (`if`, `elif`, `else`) to control program flow,  use loops (`for`, `while`) for iteration.
    * Topics: `if`, `elif`, `else` statements, Boolean expressions, `for` loops, `while` loops, `break` and `continue` statements, nested loops.
* **Week 4: Data Structures: Lists and Tuples**
    * Learning Objectives: Understand and utilize lists and tuples, learn about indexing, slicing, and basic list operations.
    * Topics: Lists – creation, accessing elements, adding/removing elements, list methods; Tuples – creation, accessing elements, immutability, tuple methods; List comprehensions (Introduction).


**Module 2: Functions, Modules, and Working with Files (4 weeks)**

* **Week 5: Functions**
    * Learning Objectives: Define and call functions, understand function arguments and return values,  scope and lifetime of variables.
    * Topics: Defining functions, function parameters and arguments, return values, function calls, scope and lifetime of variables, lambda functions (introduction).
* **Week 6: Modules and Packages**
    * Learning Objectives: Import and use built-in modules, understand the concept of packages and how to install external packages using pip.
    * Topics: Importing modules, using built-in modules (e.g., `math`, `random`, `os`, `datetime`), installing packages with `pip`, using external packages.
* **Week 7: Working with Files**
    * Learning Objectives: Read from and write to files, handle file exceptions.
    * Topics: Opening and closing files, reading from files (line by line, entire file), writing to files, handling file exceptions (`try`, `except`).
* **Week 8:  Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) Introduction**
    * Learning Objectives: Understand basic OOP concepts: classes, objects, methods, attributes, inheritance (basic).
    * Topics: Classes and objects, defining methods and attributes, instance variables, constructors (`__init__`), inheritance (simple example).


**Module 3: Advanced Topics and Projects (4 weeks)**

* **Week 9:  Dictionaries and Sets**
    * Learning Objectives: Utilize dictionaries and sets for data storage and manipulation.
    * Topics: Dictionaries – creation, accessing elements, adding/removing elements, dictionary methods; Sets – creation, set operations (union, intersection, difference), set methods.
* **Week 10:  Working with External Libraries (NumPy, Pandas - Introduction)**
    * Learning Objectives:  Install and use NumPy for numerical computation and Pandas for data manipulation.
    * Topics: Introduction to NumPy arrays, basic NumPy operations; Introduction to Pandas DataFrames, reading and writing CSV files with Pandas, basic Pandas data manipulation.
* **Week 11:  Intermediate OOP Concepts**
    * Learning Objectives:  Understand polymorphism, encapsulation, and abstraction.  Practice designing classes and object interactions.
    * Topics: Polymorphism, encapsulation, abstraction (theory and simple examples), class methods and static methods.
* **Week 12: Project Work and Review**
    * Learning Objectives: Apply learned concepts to build a small project.  Review and consolidate learned material.
    * Topics: Project ideas (choose one based on interest:  simple game, data analysis project, text-based adventure game, etc.), project presentation and peer review.



**Assessment:**

* Regular quizzes throughout the modules.
* Programming assignments to reinforce concepts.
* A final project to demonstrate understanding of learned concepts.


**Note:**  This is a suggested curriculum, the time allocation can be adjusted based on the learner's pace and understanding.  Emphasis should be placed on hands-on practice and project work to solidify learning.  Consider incorporating interactive exercises and coding challenges throughout the course.
