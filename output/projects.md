**Python Project Portfolio: A Beginner's Journey**

This portfolio outlines a series of projects designed to build your Python skills progressively, mirroring the structure of a 3-month beginner curriculum.  Each project incorporates concepts learned in the corresponding module, reinforcing theoretical knowledge with practical application.

**Module 1: Python Fundamentals (4 Weeks)**

* **Project 1: Simple Calculator (Week 2-3):**
    * **Description:** A basic calculator performing addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.  Handles user input and outputs the result.  Error handling (e.g., division by zero) can be added as an extension.
    * **Technologies:** Python's built-in functions, basic arithmetic operators, `input()` and `print()` functions.
    * **Learning Outcomes:**  Practice with data types (integers, floats), operators, variable assignment, basic control flow (if-else for error handling).

* **Project 2: Number Guessing Game (Week 3-4):**
    * **Description:** The computer generates a random number, and the user has a limited number of attempts to guess it.  Provide feedback (too high/too low).
    * **Technologies:** Python's `random` module, `input()`, `print()`, `while` loops, conditional statements (`if`, `elif`, `else`).
    * **Learning Outcomes:**  Reinforce control flow, loops, using external modules, and basic game logic.

* **Project 3: Basic List Manipulation (Week 4):**
    * **Description:** Create a program that manipulates a list of numbers.  Implement functions to add, remove, sort, and find the largest/smallest number in the list.
    * **Technologies:** Python lists, list methods (`append()`, `remove()`, `sort()`, etc.), functions.
    * **Learning Outcomes:**  Working with lists, function definitions, and list methods.


**Module 2: Functions, Modules, and File Handling (4 Weeks)**

* **Project 4: Mad Libs Generator (Week 5-6):**
    * **Description:** A program that takes user input for different parts of speech (nouns, verbs, adjectives) and then inserts them into a pre-written story template.
    * **Technologies:**  String manipulation (concatenation, formatting), user input (`input()`), functions to handle user inputs and story generation.
    * **Learning Outcomes:**  Practice with string manipulation, functions, and user interaction.

* **Project 5: File I/O: Simple Text-Based Adventure Game (Week 7-8):**
    * **Description:** A simple text adventure game where the user makes choices that affect the storyline. Story elements and game data are stored in external files.
    * **Technologies:** File input/output (`open()`, `read()`, `write()`, `close()`), error handling, conditional statements, functions.
    * **Learning Outcomes:** Working with files, integrating multiple functions, implementing game logic, and handling potential file errors.

* **Project 6: Simple OOP Project: Inventory Management (Week 8):**
    * **Description:** Design a class to represent an item in an inventory (name, quantity, price). Create methods for adding, removing, and updating items.
    * **Technologies:** Object-Oriented Programming (classes, objects, methods), lists (potentially dictionaries for advanced functionality).
    * **Learning Outcomes:** Understanding OOP concepts, designing classes, and applying methods to manage data.


**Module 3: Advanced Topics and Projects (4 Weeks)**

* **Project 7:  Data Analysis with CSV (Week 9-10):**
    * **Description:** Using a CSV file containing some simple dataset (e.g., student grades, sales data), calculate basic statistics (mean, median, standard deviation).
    * **Technologies:** The `csv` module (for reading CSV files), NumPy (for numerical operations), potentially Pandas (for easier data manipulation if introduced in the course).
    * **Learning Outcomes:**  Data manipulation, statistical calculations, using external libraries.

* **Project 8: Text-Based RPG (Week 11-12):**
    * **Description:** A more complex text-based role-playing game, incorporating inventory management, combat, and character progression (using ideas from Project 6 and enhancing them).
    * **Technologies:** OOP, file handling, user input, potentially dictionaries to represent character stats and game world data.
    * **Learning Outcomes:** Integrate previously learned concepts, apply advanced OOP techniques, and create a more robust and complex application.


**Note:**  The complexity of these projects can be adjusted according to your progress and understanding.  The key is to start small and gradually increase the challenge as you build your confidence and skills.  Remember to document your code and create a portfolio to showcase your work.
